Don't reset everything, just the stuff you need
(http://www.crucialwebhost.com/blog/master-stylesheet-the-most-useful-css-technique/)

some adjustments by Matthijs Kamstra aka [mck](mck.md) (mostly from: A CSS Framework by Mike Stenhouse of Content with Style )

**Note:** I'm not a hard-core HTML/CSS developer, but occasionally I build little websites for family/friends.

When I grabbed a css framework I've been using for a couple of years (A CSS Framework by Mike Stenhouse of Content with Style)

> I started to guess: should this framework not been updated since I first saw it online in 2005?
And so I started to build a default-template TO-RULE-THEM-ALL.
Sometimes an itch need to be scratched very thorough.
And I couldn't stop till that itch was gone.
My itch is gone, but I can imagine that this project will make you itch.... and perhaps you feel the need to scratch?
Please do, and let me know: I will add that scratch-mark to this project (if it makes sence) and will learn some more about CSS in the proces.

This template is heavely inspired by:
